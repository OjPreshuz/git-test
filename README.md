## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I learned how to effectively use CSS Grid and Flexbox to create responsive layouts, which improved my understanding of modern web design techniques. Additionally, I gained experience in structuring semantic HTML5, enhancing accessibility and SEO for my projects.


### Continued development

In the future, I plan to explore more advanced CSS techniques, such as animations and transitions, to enhance user experience. Additionally, I aim to improve my JavaScript skills to add interactivity to my projects.
Additionally, I would like to focus on improving my skills in responsive design and accessibility to ensure that my projects are usable for a wider audience.
